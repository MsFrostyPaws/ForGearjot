# Is it Prime?

This is a API for checking prime numbers.
### API Endpoint Format:

```json
POST/
[10, 30, 13, 7]
```

```json
Response: 
[false, false, true, true]
```

If any element in the input array is not a valid integer, the API returns an error message in the response:

```json
POST/
[79, 51, 44, "nan"]
```

```json
{
  "error": "the given input is invalid, element on index 4 is not a number"
}
```
