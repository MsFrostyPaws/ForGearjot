API for checking prime numbers.

You can simply run it by:\
`
make run
`

And simply test by \:

`
make test
`

I also added a rest client. You can find it in the folder *\tests\rest\PrimeNumberTester.http*, edit request values and run it by **send**.
(Maybe you need to add a "REST Client" extensions).

Added benchmarks to tests.
